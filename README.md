### Avoid thinking in terms of components in Elm

[Evan discusses his concerns with the use of the word component](https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/4xsqhd/practical_examples_in_elm/?)
Summary: components == objects and we don't make an Elm program out of objects.

Gem:

> Elm doesn't have monads and applicative functors. Instead, we thought about it for a few years until we came up with the name `andThen`. We avoided a whole boatload of pedagogical problems by choosing the right term and framing. People just "get it" and no one has to write a tutorial
